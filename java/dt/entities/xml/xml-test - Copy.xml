The figure depicts a hockey puck sliding with constant speed vo in a straight line from point &quot;a&quot; to point &quot;b&quot; on a frictionless horizontal surface. Forces exerted by the air are negligible. You are looking down on the puck. When the puck reaches point &quot;b,&quot; it receives a swift horizontal kick in the direction of the heavy print arrow. Had the puck been at rest at point &quot;b,&quot; then the kick would have set the puck in horizontal motion with a speed vk in the direction of the kick.</contextdescription>
